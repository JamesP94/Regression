# Interpretation

1. Model 2, predicting Operating Revenue, significantly outperforms Model 1, which predicts Operating Income. Model 2 explains about 77.9% of the variability in Operating Revenue (R-squared = 0.779) and is highly statistically significant (Prob (F-statistic) = 7.73e-17), indicating a strong fit. Conversely, Model 1 explains only 9.9% of the variability in Operating Income (R-squared = 0.099) and is not statistically significant (Prob (F-statistic) = 0.317), suggesting it lacks some explanatory variables or.

2. Neither model shows that compensation levels significantly impact Operating Income or Revenue, suggesting that other unmeasured factors might be more influential. However, the availability of beds significantly influences Operating Revenue in Model 2, where both Medium and High bed availability categories show substantial positive effects. This indicates that increased bed capacity likely leads to higher revenue generation, aligning with the expectation that more beds increase service capacity. In contrast, these variables do not significantly impact Operating Income in Model 1.
