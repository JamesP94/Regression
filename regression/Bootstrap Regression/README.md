# Bootstrapping Regression Statistics

This assignment asks you to use the bootstrap technique we've discussed
to generate bootstrap statistics and compare those to the standard estimates
from R. The details are in `reg_boot.rmd`. Cheers!

When you submit your work, make sure to "knit" your RMD to an `.html` file and include that file in the repo you submit. (You can also knit to PDF and Word formats, which are great, but the HTML files are a bit easier for me to evaluate.)
